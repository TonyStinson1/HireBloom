This README provides some information for the mobile app developer to connect into the Hirefly backend.

There are 3 developer environments for the backend:
 1) local dev
 2) staging server
 3) production server

 We recommend the mobile app have some configuration flags to allow the developer to hit either the staging
 server (in case of some new feature development), or the production server.

 The url for the production backend server is: "https://sourcerer-ai.herokuapp.com/"
 The url for the staging backend server is: "https://sourcerer-ai-staging.herokuapp.com/"
  
 All endpoint resources are hidden behind these urls, followed by v1/resource_name/optional_subresource_name. The full
 list of resources currently availble is copied at the bottom of this file, though it is not expected that the mobile
 app will need very many of these.  We will add scripts with usage examples for the resources that seem necessary for
 various mobile screens to this folder. If documentation about an endpoint resource below is not included but seems
 necessary, please ask for details.

 Most of these endpoints are authenticated behind a user session token, which is obtained from the backend during the
 log in procedure. This session token must be passed into headers into the X-Parse-Session-Token field, this will be
 clear on the API reference examples. We have provided a sample session token in the API reference for one of our
 accounts, but to obtain your own,
 - log into the web application at www.hirefly.ai
 - Click inspect and then Application
 - Under Storage, go to Local Storage
 - under www.hirefly.ai you should see the field "session" - you can copy and use this value as your session token
 until user authentication is built out on the mobile app
